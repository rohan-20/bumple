#  Bumple

Bumple is an Android app built using Kotlin that automatically detects road potholes and bumps in real-time using the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors of a smartphone.
It also geo-tags the detected pothole locations using GPS, making it easier to map and report poor road conditions.

# Features

Automatic Detection – Detects potholes and bumps while traveling without manual input.

Sensor-based Accuracy – Uses accelerometer and gyroscope data for reliable detection.

Geo-tagging – Captures GPS coordinates for each detected pothole.

Background Operation – Works even when the phone screen is off.

Data Logging – Stores pothole data locally for analysis or reporting.
